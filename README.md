Xenia, the linux mascot
=================

This is the public repository for the website at https://xenia-linux-site.glitch.me/
You can suggest changes directly as a PR, but try to follow the same style and triple check your sources. Images should be uploaded to https://github.com/Efimero/xenia-images at their full size, uncropped, as the author released them and appropriate credits MUST be given.

Before adding an author, check if their profile is in the `people.txt` file. If it is there, use that reference and update it if appropriate. If not, create a new reference if there is a good link to identify them with.

The website is built using racket. It reads the `data.txt` and `people.txt` files and does some custom parsing to generate the main website. Images are displayed directly from the images folder, no thumbnails. If you need to build the site, you can run `build.sh` to call the right racket command. It's very simple anyway.

If you want to PR, but are not comfortable with the format you can just provide the images in the PR to the `xenia-images` repo and leave the links and metadata in the comments to the PR committed. It's ok. If you don't know how to make a PR, just contact me on [chitter](https://chitter.xyz/@efi) or [email](mailto:ardecopon+xenia@gmail.com).
